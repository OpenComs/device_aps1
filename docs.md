The APS1 is a single line one output, power supply for analog partyline communication systems. APS1 is the most basic power supply unit possible. 

## Concept
The APS1 was designed for simplicity as a base to show how the APSM1 could be used.

The power supply is composed of 

 - One 220v IEC C14 AC input
 - One iluminated power switch
 - One partyline output
 - One switch for the terminaison

The 3D printed case & cover is availible at:

 - Case: [[Solidworks source]](3d/case.sldprt) [[STL]](3d/case.stl) 
 - Case cover: [[Solidworks source]](3d/case_cover.sldprt) [[STL]](3d/case_cover.stl) 

## Cost

The overall cost of this device is pretty low, especially if you build multiple of them.

Here is an approximation of the cost to build 1 power supply:

| What | Bought were | Cost |  Quantity | Comment |
|------|-------------|------|-----------|---------|
| APSM1 | - | <5eur | 1 |  |
| [HLK-20M24](https://aliexpress.com/item/4001022630440.html) | Aliexpress | 2.96eurs | 1 | The actuall power supply 24v 20W |
| [NC3MAAH (Male XLR)](https://fr.farnell.com/neutrik/nc3maah/plug-xlr-pcb-horizontal-3pole/dp/1310044) | Farnell | 1.656eur | 1 |  |
| [Latching 12mm switch with LED](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005002348278493.html) | Aliexpress | 1.61eur | 1 | Power switch |
| [SPST ON-ON Switch](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/4001233376500.html) | Aliexpress | 1eur | 1 | Terminaison switch |

Which comes to approximatively 8eur without 3d printed parts
*Note that some of the part here can be salvaged or found for way cheaper, which will bring the cost down even more*
